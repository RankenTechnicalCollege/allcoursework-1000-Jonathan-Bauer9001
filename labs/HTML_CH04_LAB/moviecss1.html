<p>The film follows five simultaneous, loosely linked plot lines, that intertwine and scramble together. A man (Tadanobu Asano) keeps killing his wife (Reika Hashimoto) and burying her in the woods only to find her alive, furious, and waiting for him when he returns home. A suburban family's life is disrupted when the father (Ittoku Kishibe) is permanently hypnotized into believing he is a bird and tries to learn how to fly. A trio of aimless youth pass time by burgling houses. A murderous advertising executive (Kyōko Koizumi) tries to imagine ideas for commercials. The stories clash together through the intervention of a thuggish hitman (Vinnie Jones) and his translator (Yoshiyoshi Arakawa).</p>
