    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>Currently, I'm working towards my associate degree while attending Ranken Technical College's Application & Web Development Technology program. I expect to graduate with my degree in May of 2026. The last four years I have worked my way up from a cook to a manager at my current job. My current employer has taught me how to communicate with others and train new team members. As well as to learn, apply new skills, and adapt to the situation. These are a few skills I know I can take with me as I grow.</p>
