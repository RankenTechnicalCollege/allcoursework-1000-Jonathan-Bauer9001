    <p>Jonathan's favorite hobby.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
      <div class="summary">
        <p>Miniature painting is the act of painting small figurines, models and other miniatures. The hobby can be very relaxing and rewarding. You can be painting miniatures that came with your favorite board game, 3D print miniatures if you have one, or buy kits you have to assemble yourself. Time spent building the miniatures, cleaning up detail, sometimes adding more, and use of various painting techniques can really change the outcome. Wether you were going for a realistic look or something unique to your own art style, you get to bring it to the table top for some gaming or display it to the world.  </p>

        <!--summary/tie together the list above in paragraph form in order-->
        <p>All you need to get started is <i>paint brushes, miniatures,and hobby paint</i>. Just going to your nearest hobby store and getting a decent-not too expensive, not too cheap- set of <i>paint brushes</i> with at least a size 0, 1, and 2 will last you a long time if taken care of. If you have a board game with <i>miniatures</i> included you can start with those if you like, or visit your local game store, buy online, and even 3d print some if you have access to one. Online might be the easiest in some situations as some places don't have hobby shops that might carry miniatures you like. Definitely get something you like! Pick something you think is cool and you know you want to slap some paint on it to bring it to life. Last must have supply is <i>model paint</i>. Just starting off with a small basic color set will most likely get you where you need to be. <i>Model paints</i> from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Army-Painter-Warpaints-Fanatic-Brush/dp/B0CVGQ7BZD/ref=sr_1_1?crid=FO5R9IDUEWWN&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.HNstd1z6qc7860NxLLdB1RJijMYTP0dx8e7FseDodat-onQ0_NZ8-DJ_mffwBPjoZOSFuMuwdKXHgqZr4UMt9p8iZDXyc1tOUsx-gfOkOeHy59Cbup1EAxfK3v02jXcCWyjJi_HLXAWE3zLEgjX1TMqCwzYq3Hi7auSj3oZdvq3KQgfKZgA5gbBcC2sF5Mb4b7u_aZuC84NHeIz7pKYeupsE4TcaogdoJIj9pL6-NjqLFHubjKlzHpBnhE5U-64aMs6RiU1Ayx9L3qozLAvT2xQKI3BRrONoU3CmhDctIPM.lXKqijs5xqhOZ2psHeYV2Ofm1SlzSBzHIyBXIa4bnKs&dib_tag=se&keywords=army+painter+fanatic+starter&qid=1725712457&sprefix=army+painter+fanatic+starte%2Caps%2C251&sr=8-1" target="_blank">Army Painter's Fanatic Line</a> would be a great place to start. It even comes with a miniature. They will also teach you how to thin your paints to the right consistancy with some water.  </p>
